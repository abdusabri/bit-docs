Importing components to a repository using Bit, enables you to source any components in any repository while keeping all changes synced.

Bit makes component development easy and by providing a distributed component development workflow. This means each component can be sourced and developed from any repository while preserving **one source of truth**, that is located in the component's remote Scope.  
For example, you can make local modifications to components and then either contribute them back or keep them sourced in your repository, while keeping the components synced to their origin for updates.  
You can envision this workflow as if you were able to "inject" any dependency and source it right into your repository with a single command, and "eject" it back as a dependency after making your changes.

To better understand this, import the component [string/left-pad](https://bitsrc.io/bit/utils/string/left-pad) and source it in the following project's directory structure.

```bash{5}
$ tree .
.
├── bit.json
├── package.json
└── src
    ├── hello-world
    │   ├── hello-world.js
    │   └── index.js
    └── utils
        ├── noop.js
        └── left-pad.js

3 directories, 6 files
```

Initialized Bit:

```bash 
$ bit init

successfully initialized an empty bit Scope.
```

To import the component [string/left-pad](https://bitsrc.io/bit/utils/string/left-pad) into the `src` directory, use [bit import](/docs/cli-import.html):

```bash
$ bit import bit.utils/string/left-pad --path src/left-pad
```

[bit import](/docs/cli-import.html) sources the component to the given path. In this example, the component [string/left-pad](https://bitsrc.io/bit/utils/string/left-pad) is sourced to `src/left-pad`.

```bash{6,7,8,9,10}
$ tree .
.
├── bit.json
├── package.json
└── src
    ├── left-pad
    │    ├── is-string.js
    │    ├── left-pad.js
    │    ├── left-pad.spec.js
    │    └── index.js
    ├── hello-world
    │   ├── hello-world.js
    │   └── index.js
    └── utils
        └── noop.js

3 directories, 6 files
```

As you can see, the component [string/left-pad](https://bitsrc.io/bit/utils/string/left-pad) is now sourced in this repository `src/left-pad`.  
To require this component you can use either relative paths or absolute paths see [Linking components section](#linking-components).

> **Note**
>
> Imported components should be tracked by your SCM (Git, Mercurial, etc.).
> Updates would still be available through merge once applicable.

## Import a different component version

When you import a component, by default the latest version is imported. You can import a different version by specifying the version after an `@` sign:

```bash
$ bit import bit.examples/string/left-pad@0.0.11
```

## Switch between different component versions

A local Scope contains all objects and versions of all sourced components in a workspace. This means that if you need to use an older, or newer, version of a component (to test its validity with a project, for example), you can run the [checkout](/docs/cli-checkout.html) command which will switch between local copies of component versions in your workspace.

```bash
$ bit checkout foo/bar@2.9.2
```

## Dependencies

Components can have dependencies. Bit automates the installation of component dependencies using package managers (NPM or Yarn).

```bash
$ bit install
```

[bit install](/docs/cli-install.html) installs all dependencies, whether they were defined in your `package.json` or in each of the sourced components.  
By default, Bit would try to use Yarn to leverage [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) for optimized installation of all dependencies. Otherwise, if an installation of Yarn was not found, Bit would use NPM.

> **Note**
>
> To learn more on how to configure NPM and Yarn to install Bit components, please see [Install Components using Package Manager](/docs/installing-components-using-package-managers.html).

### Yarn workspaces

[Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) is a Yarn feature that allows you to install dependencies from multiple `package.json` files in subfolders of a single root `package.json` file.  
As components have separate `package.json` files, [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) is ideal for the installation of component dependencies.  
To configure Bit to use Yarn for dependencies installation, configure the following in your project's [bit.json](/docs/conf-bit-json.html#packagemanager--string).

```js{2}
{
  "packageManager": "yarn"
}
```

### NPM

Dependencies can be configured to be installed with NPM.  
To configure Bit to use NPM for dependencies installation, configure the following in your project's [bit.json](/docs/conf-bit-json.html#packagemanager--string) file.

```js{2}
{
  "packageManager": "npm"
}
```

## Bindings

In reality, although code may be built for modularity, files may require each other relatively, as shown in the example component [string/left-pad](https://bitsrc.io/bit/utils/string/left-pad/code).

```js
import isString from '../is-string';
```

Relative paths (`../is-string`) couple a component to a specific project directory structure, thus making the component hard to reuse from other project structures.  
Bit aims to make code sharing frictionless by isolating components in their original context.  
To do this, whenever relative import statements are being used in components, Bit generates `bindings`, which is a special kind of files that verifies that the component dependencies would be resolved from any project structure, without delivering redundant or duplicated code.

For example, the [string/left-pad](https://bitsrc.io/bit/utils/string/left-pad) component, depends on the component [string/is-string](https://bitsrc.io/bit/utils/validation/is-string) and uses a relative import statement to call it.  
To make sure [string/is-string](https://bitsrc.io/bit/utils/validation/is-string) is resolved correctly, Bit creates a binding file in the correct path of the component that includes an absolute import statement to the dependency.

`is-string.js`

```js
module.exports = require('@bit/bit.examples.string.is-string');
```

To reduce this binding file size, use the absolute path above in the component's source code instead of the relative path, and tag a new version for the component.

> **Tip**
>
> To reduce and flatten a component file system structure, you can modify your code to use absolute paths.
> For more information, please see [Linking components](#linking-components).

## Link components

Once a component is imported to a repository, Bit would generate a link in your `node_modules` directory by the package name - pointing to the component path in your project's directory structure.  
Links are generated by default when importing components or by explicitly running [bit link](/docs/cli-link.html), as you can see in the example below.

```bash
$ bit link
```

Linking components in `node_modules` allows you to import a component using an absolute path and avoid changing import paths once "ejecting" the component to be a dependency of your project and vice-versa.

For example, after importing the component [string/left-pad](https://bitsrc.io/bit/utils/string/left-pad), a link would be generated and you would be able to import the component from any file in your project, similar to the following example.

```js
import padLeft from '@bit/bit.examples.string.left-pad';
```

If absolute paths were used, after exporting the component to be used as an external dependency, everything would work properly and the dependency would be resolved correctly by the node module system.

Another aspect of linking, also performed by [bit link](/docs/cli-link.html), deals with links between components and their sourced dependencies.

For example, let's say we have a component, `bit.examples/string/left-pad`, that depends on another component,  `bit.examples/string/curry`. We want to update the `curry` component, so we'll source it in our project.

```bash
$ bit import bit.examples/string/curry
```

This allows us to update the code, but what happens if we want to check its dependent's behavior? `left-pad` consumes `curry` from the `node_modules` directory, which means it will invoke the old code.
Once we run [bit link](/docs/cli-link.html), `left-pad` will consume `curry` from the updated sourced component.

## Default directory convention

You can configure a default directory for component sourcing in your project's [bit.json](/docs/conf-bit-json.html) configuration file.

```js{2}
{
  "defaultComponentPath": "src/{namespace}-{name}"
}
```

Once applying the configuration above, any new imported component will be placed according to this defined convention.  
Let's import the example component `string/left-pad` without specifying the target path.

```bash
$ bit import bit.examples/string/left-pad
```

This component would be sourced in your project's structure according to this convention.

```bash{6,7,8,9,10}
$ tree .
.
├── bit.json
├── package.json
└── src
    ├── string-left-pad
    │    ├── is-string.js
    │    ├── left-pad.js
    │    ├── left-pad.spec.js
    │    └── index.js
    ├── hello-world
    │   ├── hello-world.js
    │   └── index.js
    └── utils
        └── noop.js

3 directories, 6 files
```

As you can see in the example above, the component was sourced according to the defined convention in directory `string/left-pad`.

## Track component changes

Once a component is imported, changes can be made to the component as Bit continues to track it.  
For example, if after importing `string/left-pad`, any of its file is modified, run `bit status` to see that Bit register the component as `modified`.

```bash
$ bit status
modified components
  > string/pad-left
```

## Upgrade a dependency of a sourced component

Imported (sourced) component is isolated from the project's environment (using its own `node_modules` directory, a dedicated build flow, etc). This means that updating its dependencies needs to happen in the component's isolated environment - i.e the folder the component is imported to.

The following describe the steps Bit takes in order to determine the component's dependencies and their versions.

1. According to the data models stored in the scope (`.bit` folder).
2. According to the content of the component's `bit.json` file.
3. According to the component's `package.json` file.
  1. Look for a `package.json` file in the component's directory.
  2. If not found, propagate to project's root directory, and look for `package.json` in each directory.
  3. If no `package.json` found, check the version of the package in the `node_modules` directory.
4. According to the data in the `.bitmap` file.
5. According to the data in the `bit.json` file that stored in the project's root directory.
6. According to the `package.json` in the project's root directory.

This means that the most straightforward way of changing a component package dependency version, is to either edit its `bit.json` or `package.json` files.

## Version a sourced component

If a component is listed as modified, and the modification needs to be exported back to the remote Scope, you will need to `tag` the component and `export` it to the Scope. Just as you'd do to a newly tracked component.

```bash
$ bit tag string/left-pad
$ bit export bit.utils
```

### Fetch updated objects for a sourced component

When you start working with a project that has sourced Bit components, and the project itself is managed by an SCM tool, you will need to fetch the remote object of each component, in order to avoid merge conflicts when you modify and export new versions for them (similar to `git fetch`).  
In order to do that, you will need to run the `import` command, without any parameters, as follows.

```bash
$ bit import
```

> **Overwrite component source code**
>
> If you want to overwrite local sourced components when running `bit import`, simply add the `--write` flag. This will tell Bit to update all local sourced components with their new versions.

## Eject component back as a dependency

With Bit, it's possible to eject a component so it can be used as an external dependency after [export](/docs/cli-export.html).

```bash
$ bit export string/left-pad bit.examples --eject
```

To learn more about exporting and ejecting components, see [this section](/docs/organizing-components-in-scopes.html#remove-a-component-from-your-repository-after-an-export) in the docs.

## Compare component changes

When you have a modified component, and you are not sure why it is listed as 'modified', you can use the `bit diff` command. This will show you the difference in the component's meta-data, and help you understand why the component is listed as modified.

The component may be modified due to changes within the files it is tracking, or updates to its dependencies (packages or other components).
